# ReactJS Weather App

Progress as of **3/21/2022**
The `Today` card is basically finished. Had to redesign it since I couldn't find any free pollen APIs, but I'm still happy with this. If I find one, I'll consider incorporating a pollen API after I get the main stuff done.

It's currently filled with hardcoded data, build my next step is to fetch the data and place them in the respective spots, then I'm gonna add the color.
