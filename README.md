# ReactJS Weather App

Progress as of **3/24/2022**
The weather app is now 99% finished, I just have to add some skeleton cards in place as a loading animation. Right now it's just two empty divs taking their places, which is definitely not a good look.

Progress as of **3/23/2022**
I got pretty much everything done. The small cards display the correct icons based on if its going to rain, snow, cloudy, or clear skys. The search bar, today card, and small cards all change colors based on the time of day. The only thing that's left is to change the background to be the appropriate color, but I ran into an issue when trying to change the body background. Something to do with it unmounting. But it's past midnight right now, so I'm going to work on it tomorrow, and it'll all be functioning correctly. I will 100% refactor the theme management though, because right now it's an absolute mess.

Just need to figure out how to assign the correct weather image for the small cards (rain, cloudy, etc), and then incorporate the themes based on the time of day.

The `Today` card is basically finished. Had to redesign it since I couldn't find any free pollen APIs, but I'm still happy with this. If I find one, I'll consider incorporating a pollen API after I get the main stuff done.

It's currently filled with hardcoded data, build my next step is to fetch the data and place them in the respective spots, then I'm gonna add the color.

Here is a picture of the themes built in Figma
